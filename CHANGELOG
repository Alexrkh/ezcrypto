0.2.2 January 4th, 2006 Bug fixes and unit tests for active_crypto

There were some serious problems with ActiveCrypto's support for having keys in associated classes. I also added unit tests to active_crypto. The support code was brutaly stolen from Rick Olson's acts_as_paranoid library. Unfortunately I disabled the schema stuff for now, but will add it in the next release, which hopefully is soon.

0.2.1 November 2nd, 2005 New method in KeyHolder

Added set_encoded_key(enc) to KeyHolder for setting a key with the Base64 encoded keyvalue.

0.2 October 30th, 2005 Ruby on Rails integration

As promised I have now included my first version of ActiveCrypto the crypto layer for ActiveRecord and Ruby on Rails.

0.1.1 August 27, 2005 Minor fixes

Thanks to Jason Vasquez mugatu at mugfu dot com for noticing that Key#to_s
called the nonexistent encoded method. 

I also made a few slight changes to the documentation.
